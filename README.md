# Design Patterns Using Immutable Classes
Ever wondered how design patterns would look like if we use only immutable data structures/classes?  

Code in this repository is strictly experimental!

In addition to standard patterns (Builder, CoR, Composite, Memento, State, Strategy) there is also a "Simplified CoR" implementation. It uses Any linq operator. It is not full CoR pattern, but still can be useful.
