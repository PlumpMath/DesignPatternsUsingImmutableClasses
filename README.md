# Design Patterns Using Immutable Classes
Ever wondered how design patterns would look like if we use only immutable data structures/classes?  

Code in this repository is strictly experimental!

In addition to standard patterns (Builder, CoR, Composite, Memento, State, Strategy) there is also a "Handler Engine" implementation. It's more like a Rules Engine pattern proposed by Martin Fowler.
